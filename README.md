## REST API with JWT Auth

This module was originally developed for a large-scale system, but I have separated to highlight its structure and functionality.

It implements JWT-based REST API auth designed for mobile app integration, however it can also be implemented for other systems.

### Packages Used

- <a href="https://jwt-auth.readthedocs.io/en/develop/laravel-installation">[tymon/jwt-auth]</a> 

## System Design

- **database**
  - **migrations**
    - Note: I used invisible method in table creation to hide the password and remmber_token fields
